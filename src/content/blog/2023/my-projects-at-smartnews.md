### miscellaneous

As an experienced developer, I have not only contributed to major projects but also collaborated with other teams on various small and large projects such as games, top cards, and UFBs. In addition, I played a crucial role in bridging the gap between the Product Manager, higher leadership, and the engineering team by learning and understanding new initiatives and directions.

Effective communication with UI designers and Product Managers has been an essential part of my work to discuss product details and ensure smooth collaboration. Moreover, I worked closely with data analysts to analyze user behavior and event logs to further improve our product's user experience.

Finally, I am actively seeking a remote or on-site position in Beijing, China. If you have any front-end openings, please feel free to contact me. I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks for reading!
