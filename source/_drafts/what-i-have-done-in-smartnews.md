As a tech lead in the US Engagement team, I oversee multiple projects that are going-on in the team, and provide both technical and non-technical suggestion while team is working on the projects. Meanwhile, I work as a key person in the team to communicate with Product Manager and higher leaderships to learn new initiatives and directions in order to better provide engineering resource.

**_ 2022 US Mid-term Election _**
I led the team to provide a best way for SmartNews users to track the real-time result on the Election Day. I built a national widget that allows users to check Senate and House election result from balance of power perspective. On the other side, I also built a local widget where users could track local results for senator in the local states, house election in districts and governor election. Furthermore, it also provides different landing pages where users could check election details such as voting progress, candidates' vote percentage, lead/won/flip information for each race at the state and county level.

US Election project has achieved a great win in number of active users, click through rate and time spent.

**_ What to Watch _**
I led the team to launch the What to Watch, a hub in the Entertainment Channel that allows users to browse trending/new release movies and TV shows to discover what to watch next. I built a movie/TV show hub page that allows users to view movie/TV show details information and trailers. What's more, I provided a series of deep links to different content providers, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and etc., by which users could quickly redirected to the places to buy movie ticket or service subscription, or buy and rent movies.

What to Watch has become the TOP 3 products in the SmartNews for user acquisition.
